# Salary_Prediction
A robust machine learning model which tries to predict the salary of various software employees using ther qualifications , work experience and country


I've used a decision tree regressor here

Employing a decision tree regressor algorithm, I trained the model to predict salary ranges based on input variables such as number of years of work experience, qualifications etc 
I have also created an explore page to get various insights about the dataset i have used. 

The custom responsive page is created using streamlib python library

#About the dataset : 
The enclosed data set is the complete, cleaned results of the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.
The survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.

Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top 5 sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, meta.stackoverflow posts, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it.
